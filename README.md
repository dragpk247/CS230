Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room, a client of Creative Technology Solutions, is seeking to expand their game, "Draw It or Lose It", onto various operating systems. To achieve this goal, they require a comprehensive system architecture design that can support the game's deployment across multiple platforms. Specifically, The Gaming Room needs an explanation of the operating system architectures for different operating systems, including the underlying structures and components that enable the game to run smoothly on each platform. Additionally, they require an analysis of the differential file system components that represent a collection of data, which will inform the design of a file system that can efficiently store and manage game data across different operating systems. Furthermore, The Gaming Room needs an explanation of the functions of memory and storage management, including the techniques used to allocate and deallocate memory, as well as the strategies employed to manage storage resources. They also require the identification of memory management techniques that can optimize the game's performance and efficiency on each operating system. Finally, The Gaming Room needs a description of distributed systems and the networks that interconnect them, which will enable the game to be deployed across multiple servers and platforms, ensuring a seamless and responsive gaming experience for users. By addressing these requirements, the system architecture design will provide a robust and scalable foundation for the game's expansion onto various operating systems, ensuring that "Draw It or Lose It" can reach a wider audience and deliver a high-quality gaming experience.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What I did particularly well in documenting was the iterations I had to make for each part of the documentation, such as evaluation and the executive summary. I was able to break down complex technical concepts into clear and concise language, making it easy for the client to understand the system architecture design and its components. Additionally, I was able to provide a detailed analysis of the operating system architectures, file systems, memory and storage management, and distributed systems, which demonstrated my understanding of the technical requirements of the project.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document did help me with developing code by allowing me to iterate changes where it was needed and also being able to see where the code needs to be refactored. The design document served as a blueprint for the system architecture, and it helped me to identify potential issues and areas for improvement before starting to code. By working through the design document, I was able to clarify my thoughts and ideas, and it helped me to create a more organized and structured approach to coding.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I was to revise part of the document, I would revise the conclusion by trying to sum up what my findings were. The only problem is making it concise so that the client can understand everything. Since there are so many parts to my findings, it is difficult to keep the conclusion concise. To improve it, I would focus on highlighting the key takeaways and main points of the system architecture design, and provide a clear and concise summary of the benefits and trade-offs of the design.  


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by carefully reading and analyzing the requirements provided by The Gaming Room. I identified the key goals and objectives of the project, and I worked to create a system architecture design that met those needs. I considered the user's needs by thinking about how the system would be used, and how it could be designed to be intuitive, efficient, and effective. I also considered the technical requirements of the project, and I worked to create a design that was scalable, reliable, and maintainable.
It is so important to consider the user's needs when designing because it ensures that the software is usable, efficient, and effective. By understanding the user's needs, I can create a design that meets their expectations and provides a positive user experience. If the user's needs are not considered, the software may not be adopted or used as intended, which can lead to frustration and disappointment.


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing software by following a structured and iterative process. I started by gathering requirements and understanding the user's needs, and then I worked to create a high-level design that met those needs. I used techniques such as decomposition, abstraction, and modeling to break down the system into smaller components, and to identify the key relationships and interactions between those components.
In the future, I would use techniques such as Agile development, user-centered design, and test-driven development to analyze and design similar software applications. I would also use tools and technologies such as UML, design patterns, and software frameworks to create a robust and maintainable design. Additionally, I would involve stakeholders and users in the design process to ensure that the software meets their needs and expectations.
